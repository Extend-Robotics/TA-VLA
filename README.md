## TA-VLA
This repository provides the implementation of **TA-VLA: Elucidating the Design Space of Torque-aware Vision-Language-Action Models** on **openpi**.
It is branched from the original repository at commit [cd82848](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi/commit/cd82848a997b67ed96d1200637133a89b2a22aae).
Please refer to the original repository for environment setup and training details.
The following focuses only on the differences from the upstream repository.

## Torque Input Types
The file `src/openpi/shared/effort_type.py` defines the ways in which torque information is fed into openpi, covering all the experiments described in the paper.  
The types are:

- **NO**  
  No effort is used, but `TavlaInputs` still processes it for `norm_stats` computation.  
  Used for the baseline model.

- **STATE**  
  Inserts the current effort into the last `state[-14:]` so that it will be considered by the action expert.  
  Corresponds to the *DePre* method in Section 4.1.

- **LLM**  
  Projects the current effort into a token and passes it to the LLM along with image and language tokens.  
  Projector MLP: `Linear(in, 2*w) -> swish -> Linear(2*w, w)`.  
  Corresponds to the *Enc* method in Section 4.1.

- **LLM_HIS_C**  
  Concatenates current and historical effort, projects it into a token, and passes it to the LLM.  
  Corresponds to *Enc-1* in Section 4.2.

- **LLM_HIS_T**  
  Projects current and historical effort into tokens separately and passes them to the LLM.  
  Corresponds to *Enc-H* in Section 4.2.

- **EXPERT**  
  Projects effort into a token and passes it to the action expert (a component of the LLM) together with state and action tokens.  
  Corresponds to *DePost* in Section 4.1.

- **EXPERT_HIS_C**  
  Concatenates current and historical effort, projects it into a token, and passes it to the action expert.  
  Corresponds to *Dec-1* in Section 4.2.

- **EXPERT_HIS_T**  
  Projects current and historical effort into tokens separately and passes them to the action expert.  
  Corresponds to *Dec-H* in Section 4.2.

- **EXPERT_FUT**  
  Not an input type per se, but predicts future effort along with actions.  
  Corresponds to Sections 5 and 6 ( 
$π_0$ + obj).

- **EXPERT_HIS_C_FUT**  
  Inputs concatenated historical effort to the action expert and outputs future effort.  
  Corresponds to Sections 5 and 6 ($π_0$ + obs + obj).

- **EXPERT_HIS_C_L_FUT**  
  Inputs concatenated historical effort as the last token and outputs future effort.  
  A positional variant of the previous type, tested without performance improvement.

Note: These torque-handling implementations have only been tested on $π_0$ and may not be compatible with $π_0$-FAST.

## Dataset
As in the original openpi implementation, we use datasets in the standard **lerobot** format.
The difference is that we expect an additional field `observation.effort` storing the per-frame joint torque, analogous to how `observation.state` stores per-frame joint angles.

## Training
Refer to the example configurations provided in `src/openpi/training/config.py`.
When using effort inputs, be sure to pass the corresponding `effort_history` parameter.

## Deployment
For data collection and model deployment, we use a modified version of the AgileX official example code.
In addition to reading torque values from the ROS topic, this version maintains a historical torque buffer for policies that require past torque information.
